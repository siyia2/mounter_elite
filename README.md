## ELITE IMAGE MOUNTER

Simple asf bash script, that allows you to mount ISOs and/or to convert BIN/IMG to ISO, just point it to the correct path and shoot.
You can add multiple mount&conversion paths, all valid paths are mounted under /mnt/ all conversion happen in original file directory.

I have also provided options to unmount the mounted ISO or ISOs and a choice for opening the /mnt directory from the script.

For the conversions ccd2iso is used, tried it with some valid IMG and BIN files and it works.
